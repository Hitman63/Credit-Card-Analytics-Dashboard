Credit-Card-Analytics-Dashboard

This project presents a complete Credit Card Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, divided into two interactive reports:

Credit Card Customer Report – Highlights key customer demographics such as age group, gender, income level, and customer segment. This helps financial institutions understand their customer base and identify retention opportunities.

Credit Card Transaction Report – Provides insights into transaction patterns, including spending categories, regional activity, payment methods, and high-value transactions.

Both reports feature essential KPIs like total transactions, average spend, customer count, and revenue by segment. Users can explore the data using slicers and filters for drill-down analysis across time, region, and category. Overall, this project demonstrates how Power BI can turn customer and transaction data into clear, actionable insights for better credit card usage growth, risk management, and customer engagement.
